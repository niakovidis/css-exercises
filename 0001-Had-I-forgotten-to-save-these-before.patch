-# CSS Exercises
-
-These exercises are a series of css related tasks intended to complement the HTML and CSS content on The Odin Project.
-
-These exercises should be done when instructed during the course of the curriculum.
-
-> When doing the following exercises, please use all the documentation and resources you need to accomplish them. You are _not_ intended to have any of this stuff memorized at this point. Check the docs, use google, do what you need to do (besides checking the solutions) to get them done.
-
-## How to use these exercises
-
-1. Fork and copy this repository. Copies of repositories on your machine are called clones. If you need help cloning to your local environment you can learn how [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository).
-2. Go to an exercise directory and open the HTML file in your browser. You can either open the file directly, or use something like VSCode's Live Server.
-3. For each exercise, view the README, and edit the CSS file to make the output in your browser look like the images provided.
-4. Each README has a "Self Check" list. Use this to make sure you haven't missed any important details in your implementation.
-5. Don't check the solutions until you're done!
-
-## Some hints
-- The official solutions put all changes at the _end_ of the CSS file, which may duplicate some selectors (e.g. there might be a `body {}` in the given CSS, and another `body {}` in the solution). When you are working on an exercise, it is best practice to add your CSS to existing selectors instead of duplicating them at the end of the file. We're sacrificing this best practice in our official solutions to make it extra clear to you what things we changed to solve the exercise.
-- Unless listed in the self-check section, do not worry about getting the exact pixel value for things like margin, padding and font-size. These exercises are intended to test your knowledge of CSS, not your ability to guess that a screenshot is using `font: sans-serif bold 16px`, or that the margin is _exactly_ `42px`.
-- You may need to add some elements to your HTML to get things into the right spot. (For the first few exercises we make it explicit when this needs to happen.)
-- You may need to add more selectors to your CSS file. The first few exercises have almost everything already done for you, but as you progress you'll find that you need to add more and more to get the correct result.
-- In many cases, there will be multiple correct ways to solve these problems. The official solution isn't necessarily the _only right way_, but it is possible to do things in ways that are overall unhelpful. If your solution differs wildly from the official solution (and still passes the self-check criteria), feel free to ask about it in the chatroom.

-# Methods for Adding CSS
-In this exercise, you're going to practice adding CSS to an HTML file using all three methods: external CSS, internal CSS, and inline CSS. You should only be using type selectors for this exercise when adding styles via the external and internal methods. You should also use keywords for colors (e.g. "blue") instead of using RGB or HEX values.
-
-There are three elements for you to add styles to, each of which uses a different method of adding CSS to it, as noted in the outcome image below. All other exercises in this section will have a CSS file provided and linked for you, but for this exercise you will have to create the file and link it in the HTML file yourself. This is all about practicing using these different methods and getting the syntax right.
-
-The properties you need to add to each element are:
-
-* `div`: a red background, white text, a font size of 32px, center aligned, and bold
-* `p`: a green background, white text, and a font size of 18px
-* `button`: an orange background and a font size of 18px
-
-## Desired Outcome
-![desired outcome](./desired-outcome.png)
-
-
-### Self Check
-- Did you use all three methods of adding CSS to an HTML file?
-- Did you properly link the external CSS file in the HTML file?
-- Does the `div` element have CSS added via the external method?
-- Does the `p` element have CSS added via the internal method?
-- Does the `button` element have CSS added via the inline method?

-# Class and ID Selectors
-Knowing how to add class and ID attributes to HTML elements, as well as use their respective selectors, is invaluable. It's important to practice using them.
-
-There are several elements in the HTML file provided, which you will have to add either class or ID attributes to, as noted in the outcome image below. You will then have to add rules in the CSS file provided using the correct selector syntax. Look over the outcome image carefully, and try to keep in mind which elements look similarly styled (classes), which ones may be completely unique from the rest (ID), and which ones have slight variations from others (multiple classes).
-
-It isn't entirely important which class or ID values you use, as the focus here is on being able to add the attributes and use the correct selector syntax to style elements. For the colors in this exercise, try using a non-keyword value (RGB, HEX, or HSL). The properties you need to add to each element are:
-
-* **All odd numbered elements**: a light red/pink background, and a list of fonts containing `Verdana` as the first option and `sans-serif` as a fallback
-* **The second element**: blue text and a font size of 36px
-* **The third element**: in addition to the styles for all odd numbered elements, add a font size of 24px
-* **The fourth element**: a light green background, a font size of 24px, and bold
-
-Quick tip: in VS Code, you can change which format colors are displayed in RGB, HEX, or HSL by hovering over the color value in the CSS and clicking the top of the popup that appears!
-
-> ### Note:
-> Part of your task is to add a font to _some_ of these items. Do not worry about the font of the rest of them. Your browser's default font might be different than the one displayed and that's OK for this exercise.

-# Grouping Selectors
-
-Let's build a little off the previous exercise, in which you (hopefully) added multiple classes to a single element in order to apply two different rules to it.
-
-Instead of having a single element with two different rules applied, though, you're instead going to give two elements each a unique class name, then add rules for styles that both elements share as well as their own unique styles. Make sure you take a good look at the outcome image below to see exactly what is unique about each element, and what both elements have in common.
-
-This will help you further practice adding classes and using class selectors, so be sure you add the class attribute in the HTML file. For the remainder of these exercises, the format of any colors is entirely up to you; we trust you'll practice using the different values! The properties you need to add to each element are:
-
-* **The first element**: a black background and white text
-* **The second element**: a yellow background
-* **Both elements**: a font size of 28px and a list of fonts containing `Helvetica` and `Times New Roman`, with `sans-serif` as a fallback 
-
-## Desired Outcome
-![desired outcome](./desired-outcome.png)
-
-
-### Self Check
-- Does each element have a unique class name?
-- Did you use the grouping selector for styles that both elements share?
-- Did you make separate rules for the styles unique to each element?

-# Chaining Selectors
-
-Credits for the images in this exercise go to [Katho Mutodo](https://www.pexels.com/@photobykatho?utm_content=attributionCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=pexels) and [Andrea Piacquadio](https://www.pexels.com/@olly?utm_content=attributionCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=pexels).
-
-With this exercise, we've provided you a completed HTML file, so you will only have to edit the CSS file. For this exercise, it's more important to understand how chaining different selectors works than how to actually add the attributes.
-
-We have two images for you to style, each with two class names, where one of the class names is shared. The goal here is to chain the selectors for both elements, so that each have a unique style applied, despite using a shared class selector. For example, you want an element that has both X and Y to have one set of styles, while an element with X and Z has a completely different set of styles. We included the original images as well, so that you can see how the styles you will be adding look in comparison, so do not add any styles to them.
-
-The properties you need to add to each element are:
-
-* Make the element with both the `avatar` and `proportioned` classes 300 pixels wide, then give it a height so that it retains its original square proportions (don't hardcode in a pixel value for the height!).
-* Make the element with both the `avatar` and `distorted` classes 200 pixels wide, then make its height twice as big as its width (here you should hardcode in a pixel value).
-
-## Desired Outcome
-![desired outcome](./desired-outcome.png)
-
-### Self Check
-- Did you properly chain class selectors for each rule?
-- Does the `proportioned` image retain its original square proportions?
-- Does the `distorted` image end up looking squished and, well, distorted?

-# Descendant Combinator
-Understanding how combinators work can become a lot easier when you start playing around with them and see what exactly is affected by them versus what isn't.
-
-The goal of this exercise is to apply styles to elements that are descendants of another element, while leaving elements that *aren't* descendants of that element unstyled.
-
-You can use either type or class selectors for this exercise; use whichever you may feel you want to practice with more. The HTML file is set up (so no need to edit anything in it) such that any combination of selectors will work, so if you're feeling adventurous you can even try combining a type *and* class selector for the descendant combinator.
-
-The properties you need to add are:

-# CSS Methods
-This final exercise for CSS Foundations is going to give you a closer look at the cascade, in particular specificity and rule order. Both the HTML and CSS files are filled out for you, so instead of adding rules yourself, you will simply be editing what is provided.
-
-There are a few elements that have some sort of specificity or rule order issue in the provided CSS file. It's up to you to figure out what issue is affecting an element, and how to fix it. You can edit the CSS file by adding or removing selectors or moving stuff around, but you should not edit the HTML file or any of the actual style declarations in the CSS.
-
-There are multiple ways to solve this exercise, and we did our best to include all of the possible solutions for each element.
-
-Issues with the cascade can be the bane of their existence for many when it comes to CSS. While you won't become a cascade expert from this exercise alone, and there are other ways to deal with these issues, it is still super helpful to see how these issues affect our final styles and why it's important to order rules carefully.
-
-## Desired Outcome
-![desired outcome](./desired-outcome.png)
-
-### Self Check
-- Did you make sure to not edit the HTML file?
-- If you added selectors to the CSS, do they target a valid HTML element?
